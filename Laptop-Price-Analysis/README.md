# Laptop Price Analysis 

This project explores **laptop pricing trends**, examining factors that influence price variations, such as **CPU frequency, RAM size, GPU type, screen features, and weight**. It also applies regression models to predict laptop prices based on technical specifications.  

## Key Insights: 
- RAM size is the strongest predictor of price, showing a strong positive correlation.  
- Higher CPU frequency contributes to increased laptop cost, though its impact varies across models.
- Screen size and weight have relatively weak correlations with price, indicating other factors drive cost more significantly.  
- Polynomial regression improves price prediction accuracy, outperforming simple linear models.
