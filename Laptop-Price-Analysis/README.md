## Laptop Price Analysis 

This project examines **laptop pricing trends**, exploring how various specifications—including **CPU frequency, RAM size, GPU type, screen size, storage type, and weight**—impact price. Additionally, machine learning models predict laptop costs based on technical specifications.  

## Key Insights: 
- RAM size strongly correlates with laptop price, suggesting memory size is a key pricing factor.  
- CPU frequency and core count moderately impact laptop cost, but vary across categories.  
- Storage capacity contributes significantly, with SSD size positively affecting prices.  
- Weight and screen type have minimal correlation with price, reinforcing that portability isn’t a primary driver of cost.  
- Polynomial regression provides better predictions compared to simple linear models, yielding improved accuracy in estimating laptop prices.
