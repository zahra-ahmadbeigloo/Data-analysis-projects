### Interactive Fuel Consumption Analysis Dashboard built with:
- **Python** for backend logic and data manipulation
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for efficient data preprocessing and statistical calculations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for high-quality visualizations
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
- **PolynomialFeatures** & **StandardScaler** for feature transformation

# Fuel Consumption Analysis
This project analyzes vehicle fuel consumption, CO₂ emissions, and engine characteristics, using structured data and predictive models to uncover key relationships between fuel economy and emissions.

## Key Insights:
- Engine Size vs. CO₂ Emissions → Strong correlation between engine size and carbon emissions.
- Fuel Type Impact → Vehicles using hybrid systems show significantly lower emissions compared to conventional gas models.
- Transmission Type Matters → Manual transmissions tend to be more fuel-efficient.
- Regression Models for CO₂ Prediction → Multiple regression models help estimate emissions based on vehicle attributes.
