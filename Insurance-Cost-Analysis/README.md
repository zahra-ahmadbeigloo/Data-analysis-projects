# Insurance Cost Analysis

This project analyzes **medical insurance costs** based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. Using structured data and regression models, it uncovers insights into the factors influencing insurance charges.  

## Key Insights:
- **Smoking is the Most Influential Factor** → Smokers exhibit the **highest correlation** with medical expenses.  
- **Age Affects Costs** → Insurance charges tend to **increase significantly with age**.  
- **BMI Impacts Charges** → Higher BMI leads to **higher insurance costs**, highlighting the financial burden of obesity.  
- **Predictive Models Provide Reliable Estimates** → Various regression models can forecast **insurance costs based on personal attributes**.
