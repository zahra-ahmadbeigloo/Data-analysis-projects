# Price Analysis
## Overview
This project is designed to analyze car pricing data using various data science and machine learning techniques. We use libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `sklearn` to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models.
