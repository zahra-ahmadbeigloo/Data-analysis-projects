# Airline Performance Analysis ‚úàÔ∏è

This project, part of the **Data-Analysis-Projects** repository, explores airline performance using data visualization and statistical analysis. The notebook **Airline-Performance.ipynb** includes **19 plots** (18 static, 1 animated) to help uncover patterns and insights in airline operations.

Since GitHub does not render plots from notebooks by default, screenshots and a GIF have been added for clarity.

## üìä Project Overview

This analysis covers:

- Flight delays and cancellations
- Airline and airport performance trends
- Passenger traffic over time
- Weather impact on flights
- Animated hourly flight behavior

## üöÄ Run Locally

To view the full interactive analysis:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Analysis-Projects.git
cd Data-Analysis-Projects
jupyter notebook Airline-Performance.ipynb
```

Ensure the `plots/` folder is in the same directory for the README visuals to display properly.
